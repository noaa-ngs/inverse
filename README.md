# inverse
The geodetic inverse, program INVERSE, is the tool for computing the geodetic azimuth and distance between two points, given their latitudes and longitudes.

The three-dimensional versions of the geodetic inverse program INVERS3D includes the ellipsoid height component.  Also included in the 3D programs are:

1) Conversions between geodetic positions (latitude, longitude, and ellipsoid height) and rectangular coordinates (X,Y,Z in the
Conventional Terrestrial Reference System).

2) Conversions between the following four observation sets:
   a) DN,DE,DU (differential N, E, U using the FROM station 
       as the origin of the NEU-coordinate system.)
   b) DX,DY,DZ (differential X, Y, Z used to express GPS vectors)
   c) delta height, forward azimuth, ellipsoidal distance
   d) delta height, forward azimuth, mark-to-mark distance
